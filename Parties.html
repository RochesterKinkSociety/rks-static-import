                    <h4>Coming as a Guest</h4>
                    Guests of RKS must be 18 years of age, and are required to RSVP for
                    approval in advance. Approval manner depends on how the guest is
                    being invited:
                    <ul>
						<li>
							<i>First Time Guests</i> After attending a munch or social 
							with us, guests are welcome to e-mail RKS (<a href="mailto:secretary@RochesterKinkSociety.com">secretary@RochesterKinkSociety.com</a>) 
							with information about what event they would like to attend. 
							The Board of Directors will discuss and respond with either 
							acceptance or a request for the individual to attend more 
							vetting events before being welcome at a more private event. 
							These requests must be sent 48 hours prior to the event of interest.
                        <li>
                            <i>Prior Guests.</i> Guests who have attended
                            within the last 2 years are welcome to attend again, but must
                            <a href="mailto:secretary@RochesterKinkSociety.com">RSVP <span class="printonly">(secretary@RochesterKinkSociety.com)</span></a> at least 48
                            hours in advance. If you haven't attended an event in a few years,
                            it's on a case-by-case basis.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i>Member invitation.</i> Members that have
                            completed their 6 month trial period are granted the
                            privilege of inviting guests. Requests to bring a guest must be
                            <a href="mailto:secretary@RochesterKinkSociety.com?subject=Request%20to%20bring%20a%20guest">
                                sent to the board <span class="printonly">(secretary@RochesterKinkSociety.com)</span>
                            </a> 24 hours
                            before an event for validation. The inviting party is responsible
                            for their guests; repeatedly bringing poorly chosen, ill-behaving
                            guests may result in loss of inviting privilege.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i>Members of other BDSM groups.</i> Visitors
                            who are coming from another city, and can provide a referral from
                            another known, established BDSM group should

                            <i>Special Cases.</i> Other situations will
                            be considered on a case-by-case basis. Such requests should be sent
                            be <a href="mailto:secretary@RochesterKinkSociety.com?subject=Guest%20request-other">

                        </li>
                    </ul>
					<p>
						All guests are encouraged to email the Board (<a href="mailto:rks@rochesterkinksociety.com">rks@rochesterkinksociety.com</a>) 
						to verify the location on the event of interest, as RKS events will be 
						held in various locations and will not stay constant.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        First-time guests to RKS events will have to fill out some forms 
						and will need to show a valid photo
						ID with your name and date of birth. Once signed in, new guests 
						will be given a tour of the facilities.There are no restrictions on how 
						frequently a guest may visit
                        RKS, but if you'll be attending frequently a <a href="Information/Attending.html#a-steps">membership</a>
                        is more cost-effective.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What to Expect</h2>
                    <p><a href="#content">Back to the top</a></p>
                    <p>
                        RKS is neither a sex club, swingers group, nor dating service; 
						don't expect to see or get sex. RKS is
						a place to meet other kinky people, but it is up to you to be social 
						and encourage friendship-building.
						If you happen to meet someone through RKS and hit it off, we're 
						happy for you! But becoming a
						member makes no guarantees when it comes to finding a relationship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Expect to take some initiative on socializing- someone will show you around when you arrive and
						some members will introduce themselves. But, others will be busy catching up with friends they
						haven't seen in a while— be prepared to introduce yourself or join in a conversation. Hiding in the
						corner is likely to yield an unsatisfactory experience. Many of our members are thrilled to get to know
						and talk to new faces. Feel free to include yourself in conversations, you will most like get a positive
						response in return.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are coming into RKS from being an "online" player, 
						expect to relearn everything you know.
						Online play is often unrealistic and stereotyped—most notably, 
						if you're a Dominant, you're not every
						submissive's Dominant; if you're a sub, don't grovel 
						before every Dominant. Until you find someone
						and start to play, we're all equals. When you're done playing, 
						you're back to being equal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do not expect that just because you've played with someone, that
                        you will start dating or that they will go home with you. If that's
                        something you want, talk about it <em>beforehand</em>. Miscommunication and
						unspoken expectations can lead to a bad experience for everyone involved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Expect people to be, well, people. Just because we're into BDSM
                        doesn't mean you must like everyone, or that we're all great. We're
                        regular people with jobs, families, and other interests. Like any
                        group, our membership is composed of people who are friendly and
                        mean, shy and outgoing, resilient and fragile, easy-going and
                        pompous. What you can expect is for others to show the same respect
                        to you, that we expect of you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Expect to see people of all genders (not just male &amp; female)
                        with an assortment of sexual orientations, fetishes &amp;
                        interests, in various states of dress or undress including nudity.
                        There may be people dressed to the hilt in leather, PVC, rubber,
                        lingerie and corsets while others are in a T-shirt and comfortable
                        jeans (black and red are popular colors). Expect to see things
                        you're totally intrigued by, and conversely expect things you are
                        not entirely comfortable with— and be prepared to remind
                        yourself that it is consensual.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, don't expect everyone to be into every aspect of
                        play. Some people won't have your interests, and there may even be
                        some who are bothered by your kinks. Remember that they're allowed
                        their feeling, but expect them to respect your interest as valid
                        too.
                    </p>

                    years of age or older, the minimum age for attending any RKS event.

                        This overview covers the major points. Before attending a party,
                        you should review the complete <a href="Information/Rules.html">
                            play

                        Party atmosphere depends on which room you're in, what night you
                        attend, and who else is there.

                            Our main dungeon features loud music, mostly with a rhythm,
                            which many like to scene to.
                        </li>

                            The annex and addition are a small and medium dungeon,
                            respectively. They are without sound systems, although the sound of
                            the main dungeon carries in.

                            The vault is a small room that's quieter and has a door that
                            can be closed. Closed-circuit TV allows DMs and others to watch
                            play in the vault.
                        </li>

                        To accommodate the variety of members tastes, music is block
                        formatted so a particular genre plays at a particular time. Blocks
                        are arranged to minimize dramatic, abrupt changes.
