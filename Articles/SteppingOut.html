                If you are old enough to remember the old television program,
                Batman, starring Adam West that aired during the late 1960's,
                you'll know that the show always ran in double episodes. In the
                first episode, the plot would take shape, Batman and Robin would
                identify the villain (ie. The Penguin, The Riddler, or possibly
                Catwoman, in her kinky skin tight leather outfit), then the Dynamic
                Duo would enter his or her evil lair, it would always be a trap
                (they never learned), and by the end of episode 1, Batman, and
                usually Robin too, would be in some kind of precarious predicament
                involving ropes, chains, scalding vats of liquid and/or saw blades.
                Thinking back I realize that this was probably my introduction into
                the excitement of bondage and discipline, dominance and submission,
                sadism and masochism (BDSM), and to be honest, it was kind of hot.
                The producers would sadistically leave you hanging for 24 hours,
                until Episode 2, which always brought a great fight scene, with a
                "POW!" and a "BAM!" and a "ZONK!" And the Dynamic Duo would once
                again save the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last month I visited the Rochester Kink Society and I learned so
                much about the BDSM community that I found I could not do justice
                to the subject in one small article. So, in the grand tradition of
                the Batman TV series cliff-hanger, this article will be presented
                to you in two parts. And yes, I most definitely will leave you
                hanging on the edge of your seat, waiting desperately for the
                thrilling conclusion. Only you will have to wait not a single day,
                but an entire month! Ha! Ha! Ha! (Evil laugh)
            </p>
            <p>
                This episode begins about 2 years ago, when I was invited by a
                Gay Alliance Speakers Bureau member, to visit the Rochester Kink
                Society (RKS). I hesitated for three reasons. First of all, the
                purpose of my "Stepping OUT" project is to visit and learn about
                LGBT community groups. RKS, although extremely welcoming, is not an
                LGBT organization. Second, I did not want people reading my article
                to associate "kink" exclusively with "gay." The third reason I
                hesitated was that I was <em>nervous</em>! Whips and chains?!!
                Suspension and hot wax?!! Kinky Knitting Night?!! Really? Ok,
                admittedly, that one didn't sound so bad.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the past few years, however, as I visited other groups that
                were not specifically LGBT (for example, Rated F, the new feminist
                group) and as I learned more about the realities of BDSM, I
                realized that it really does resonate with the work that we do at
                the Gay Alliance. BDSM and kink are about freedom, love, and the
                right to express ourselves. Many of the community members are
                closeted, due to other people's ignorance and discrimination, and,
                as it turns out, it's not just a bedroom issue. Sound familiar?
                These new revelations left me with only one excuse, I was nervous.
                Clearly it was time to get past that. Hadn't I just played nude
                volleyball with the Rochester ROMANS? What was I afraid of? I wrote
                an e-mail to RKS proposing a visit and I boldly hit the "send"
                button. (Oh ok, I admit it, first I made sure that my wild and
                crazy friend, Pam, would go with me. The new Dynamic Duo?)
            </p>
            <p>
                The response I got from Kat, Chairperson and Event Coordinator
                at RKS, was positive. First some of the RKS board members wanted to
                meet Pam and me at one of their social events. This is the first
                step to becoming a member. RKS gets to meet you, they make sure
                that you understand what the group is all about and they get a
                chance to explain their rules and policy of confidentiality. It
                also gives the potential member a chance to ask questions in a very
                comfortable environment and make sure that RKS is what they are
                looking for.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pam and I chose to attend a "social," which is in the evening at
                a local pub, rather than a "munch," which is lunch at a local
                diner, only because I was pretty sure I was going to need to have a
                drink in my hand. As it turned out, the situation was relaxed and
                comfortable and the beer was unnecessary. Todd, the RKS Vice
                Chairperson, welcomed us, chatted with us about the group and
                introduced us to some of the members. He clearly adores this group
                and he talked about the members as if they were family. There were
                about 30 people at the social that evening. It was a mix of men and
                women chatting, eating and laughing. Dress was casual, mostly jeans
                and sweatshirts. Truly, the only way to describe it was
                "normal."
            </p>
            <p>
                Todd told us that there are about 110 members of RKS.
                Approximately 30 are members of their subgroup, The Next Generation
                (TNG), which is a group for people ages 18-35. I asked Todd about
                the ratio of straight people to LGBT people at RKS. He said he
                believes members are about 5% lesbian and gay and about 5%
                transgender, but the number of women who identify as bisexual in
                this group is about 80%! I asked how open the group would be to a
                guy on guy "scene" (the word used for a BDSM setting and activity)
                and the response was positive. RKS is an open and welcoming
                group.
            </p>
            <p>
                Todd told us when we left that Pam and I should look at the RKS
                calendar and e-mail him with an event that we would like to attend.
                Pam and I chose the Skin2Skin &amp; Paw2Paw workshop, followed by a
                "Play Party" in the dungeon. The workshop was about techniques for
                bare-hand S/M play presented by a well known dominant or "Dom" in
                the BDSM community, Panther, who was being flown in from the San
                Francisco area just for the event.
            </p>
            <p>
                A few days before our RKS visit, Laura McSpadden, Gay Alliance
                Office Administrator, led an InQueery class called "BDSM: A Guide
                for Lay people, Well-wishers, and Newbies," which examined the most
                common myths about BDSM and kink. Pam and I attended, hoping the
                presentation would help us avoid any unnecessary kink faux pas.
            </p>
            <p>
                The presentation was excellent and informative. (Note: This
                presentation will be repeated. Watch for it on the <a href="http://www.gayalliance.org/education/inqueery.html">
                    InQueery
                    schedule
                </a>.) I learned, among other things, that most activities
                relating to BDSM were considered pathological until 1994, when they
                were removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
                Disorders (DSM). The behaviors now must "cause clinically
                significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
                other important areas of functioning," in order for it to be
                considered an illness. Consensual BDSM activities that are
                pleasurable to all parties involved, are now considered healthy
                sexual behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also learned that accessing medical care can often be an issue
                for people who practice BDSM. Because of requirements and reporting
                policies that medical personnel must follow regarding bruises and
                wounds on patients, people practicing BDSM may choose not to seek
                medical attention for themselves when they need help for other,
                unrelated issues. This unfortunate situation reminded me of the
                experiences of many transgender individuals, who have avoided
                seeking medical help due to discrimination and a lack of education
                among medical professionals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, we talked about how some people only participate in
                BDSM behaviors as a kind of sexual role play, and how others take
                on this lifestyle 24/7, as an ongoing master/slave type
                relationship. This brought up some male/female power issues for me
                and gave me a chance to voice some of my own personal concerns
                about the way that submissive women are treated in BDSM
                relationships. The feminist in me had trouble holding her tongue,
                she always does, and I ranted a bit about my assumption that there
                are many more submissive females than males and about how I found
                some of the behaviors degrading to women, etc. etc. Turns out there
                are, in fact, more men submissives than women. I learned that at
                the core of BDSM is trust, fulfillment, love and the giving of
                oneself. The gift of submission to a partner is that much more
                valuable when the submissive is a strong, self-confident and
                powerful person.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kim, a submissive woman who is a member of RKS, explained her
                joy at giving up power and control in this way. She said, "I used
                to be with a man who was a terrible driver. I refused to give him
                control of the car because I didn't trust him. Now I am with a man
                who loves motorcycles. I sit on the back and I trust him to control
                the vehicle and keep me safe. People keep asking me why I don't get
                my license and learn to drive the motorcycle myself. I don't want
                to. I love giving up the control to him. I get to sit back and
                enjoy the ride." Dominants must be knowledgeable, skilled and very
                in tune with their partners or else they will lose the trust that
                has been given to them. The submissive is actually the one who has
                the most power in the relationship as he/she/ze decides where the
                boundaries will be set.
            </p>
            <p>
                The night of the workshop and play party, Pam picked me up at my
                house around 5:45pm and drove us to the secret location, which had
                been entrusted to us after the social. We found it easily and sat
                for a moment in the parking lot trying to prepare ourselves for
                what lay ahead. With a deep breath, we stepped out of the car and
                walked slowly toward the dungeon. We approached the door to the
                building and rang the bell. A man welcomed us, showed us in (no
                secret handshake necessary), led us downstairs and opened up the
                door to the dungeon. "Holy Bustiers, Pam," I exclaimed! "I can't
                believe my eyes!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Flying Floggers, Jeanne! Are those people really sinking their
                teeth into…"
            </p>
            <p>
                Will this be the end of our Dynamic Duo? Will they be tied to
                tables while saws spin rapidly toward their heads? Will they be
                suspended upside down while hot wax is dripped on their feet?!!!
                Will they be gagged and forced to create kinky knitting
                projects?!!! Tune in next month! Same Bat-Time. Same
                Bat-Channel…

            <cite>
                by Jeanne Gainsburg, Gay Alliance Outreach Coordinator<br>
                First published in the Empty Closet, May 2010.
            </cite>
            <p>
                Last month, we left our Dynamic Duo, Jeanne and Pam, just
                entering the dungeon at the Rochester Kink Society (RKS). They were
                about to attend a bondage and discipline, dominance and submission,
                sadism and masochism (BDSM) workshop called Skin2Skin &amp;
                Paw2Paw, being presented by the famous Dom, Panther, followed by a
                "Play Party."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Holy Bustiers, Pam," I exclaimed! "I can't believe my
                eyes!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Flying Floggers, Jeanne! Are
                those people really sinking their teeth into… cupcakes?!!!"
            </p>
            <p>
                Fully prepared for a Batman-esque scene, with a "POW!" and a
                "BAM!" and a "ZONK!" Pam and I were shocked to find the room full
                of people chatting, drinking coffee, and eating cupcakes. Batman
                and Robin never got this treatment when they entered an evil lair!
                This part I probably could have handled without Pam.
            </p>
            <p>
                We signed in at the check in desk and then Todd came over to
                welcome us and to give us a tour (i.e., "Chain hoist over here,
                cage over there, fridge with spring water, St. Andrew's Cross,
                locker for play party clothes, padded bondage table, and bathrooms
                down the hall"). After looking around a bit, Pam and I took a seat
                with the others. The workshop started at about 7pm. There were 50
                people present.
            </p>
            <p>
                Panther, a well known Dom and BDSM educator, had been flown in
                from the San Francisco area to teach us about techniques for
                bare-hand S/m play. In the first part of the workshop, Panther and
                his volunteer assistant focused on slapping, kicking, punching,
                pinching, poking, hair pulling (you get the idea), as well as basic
                anatomy and areas of the human body that are dangerous and should
                be avoided to prevent injury. Panther talked about safe words and
                signals that everyone should know and use if they are in a
                dangerous situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                After about an hour we took a break and Pam and I had a few
                minutes to share some thoughts with each other. We had a very
                similar reaction to what we had just heard. Basically we were both
                surprised at how relatively gentle it was. Panther talked about how
                the idea of being slapped or grabbed is often what is erotic, not
                necessarily the pain. A little goes a long way. The caring, loving
                aspect of BDSM was reinforced for me repeatedly at this
                workshop.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second half of the workshop focused on nibbling, licking and
                biting. Panther donned his custom made prosthetic vampire teeth and
                nibbled and bit his capable assistant while she giggled
                uncontrollably. This really wasn't at all what I expected, and
                quite honestly, Pam and I agreed, it made us feel way kinkier than
                we originally thought we were.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the workshop, <a href="http://www.pantherprowls.com">Panther</a> displayed some of his
                <a href="http://www.pantherprowls.com">handmade floggers</a> and
                Pam and I got to hear some funny stories from members about saving
                money on sex toys by shopping at Home Depot for objects like
                clamps, rope, and tubing. One man said, "Three strikes and they're
                out. The Home Depot employees asks me what I need the object for
                the first time, I tell them something vague. They ask again, I make
                up something more detailed about some project I'm working on. They
                ask me a third time, they get the truth." He laughs. "Usually, they
                think I'm joking."

                Hardware and everyday household objects are used in BDSM play
                quite often. They are referred to as "pervertibles." LOL. Michael's
                craft store offers some necessary items for Todd and his partner
                too. He told me that scented waxes and waxes that are darker in
                color tend to burn hotter. His partner prefers a wax that burns
                cooler. It feels better to her. Hot, but not too hot. Not only was
                I touched by the care and concern that Todd had for his partner's
                pleasure, but I was deeply impressed that he would shop at
                Michael's for her!

                Pam and I left for some dinner and came back to the dungeon
                around 10:30pm for the play party. Surprisingly, I was less nervous
                entering the dungeon for the play party than I had been at any of
                the other events. Everyone was so comfortable with us being there
                and learning about RKS. I didn't know what exactly I was about to
                see, but I was no longer scared.
            </p>
            <p>
                We entered the dungeon and found about 70 people at play. The
                environment was much brighter and more casual than I expected. The
                age range at the party looked to be about 18-70. Some people were
                using equipment and involved in scenes and others were drinking
                coffee and chatting on the couches off to the side. Some people
                were nude, some were dressed in elaborate outfits (ex. bustiers and
                heels) and others were in street clothes. What it reminded me of
                most was a fitness club. Wait your turn, use the equipment, moan or
                grunt if you need to, wipe everything down when you're done, have
                some water and replenish.

                Pam and I found an empty seat in order to observe the party. We
                were not the only ones watching. No play is ever necessary at the
                dungeon. Some people just come to enjoy the scenes. Some of the
                scenes we saw were:
            </p>
            <p>
                A woman, wearing pants and a sports bra, was chained with her
                front to the wall while another woman tickled her gently with a
                feathery object. She was quiet.
            </p>
            <p>
                A woman was chained naked, except for heels, to a post while a
                man and a woman ran electrical wands up and down her body. She was
                squealing (in a good way, I'm pretty sure).
            </p>
            <p>
                A naked man was chained to a post and being flogged by a woman.
                He was quiet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two other scenes involved naked women lying on tables being
                flogged by men. They were grunting.
            </p>
            <p>
                One nude woman was slowly being suspended by a man who was using
                shibari, an elaborate type of Japanese rope work. After she was
                suspended, he applied clothes pins to her inner thigh. She was
                giggling and cooing, and she looked like she was having a
                blast.
            </p>
            <p>
                At about 11:30pm we said our
                "goodbyes" and our "thank yous," and we left. On our way out we
                laughed over a sign on the door that read, "This is your dungeon.
                Keep it clean."
            </p>

                A big thank you goes out to the Rochester Kink Society. Thank
                you for teaching me so much about BDSM and for allowing me into
                your relatively secret world. I am grateful for your trust.
            </p>
