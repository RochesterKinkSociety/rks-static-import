Frequently Asked Questions


▼ What does BDSM stand for?

BDSM stands for:
bondage and discipline (BD);
dominance and submission (DS); and
sadism and masochism (SM).
These initials (BD, DS, SM) are then run together, removing the duplicate letters to form BDSM.

Each letter pair represents subtly different types of play and interaction commonly found within our community.


▼ How is BDSM different from abuse?


BDSM is not abuse. To contrast the two, let us first take a
look at what abuse is, then see how BDSM is different.

Abuse is:
Unwanted verbal, emotional, or physical violence, often occurring in an accelerating cycle.
Characterized by lack of consent of one person to the actions of another.
Victim is often isolated and lacks ability to stop the violence or leave.
Occurs in secrecy, and results in emotional or physical injury.

Quite the opposite, BDSM
Occurs between freely consenting adults.
Is practiced with all participants aware of the potential risks and a mind towards increasing safety.
Includes explicit consent of the participants to their involvement.
Participants retain the right to stop involvement (or leave entirely) at any time if they choose to do so.
Involves the use of safe words, allowing participants to communicate clearly.
Many BDSM enthusiasts will not practice BDSM while under the influence of alcohol or drugs; neither alcohol nor drug use are allowed at RKS.

Furthermore, our play parties are staffed by DMs to ensure RKS rules are followed.

▼ Why join RKS?


See the membership information.


▼ Do I need to attend a munch/social before joining? Why?

If you live locally, yes. However, in certain cases, you may attend a
party as a guest without attending a munch. See the Attending Parties for details.


As for why:

It is a way for you to check out the group, first of all.We do this to
protect our members and our society's integrity and confidentiality.
In a nutshell, we like to keep our regular meeting location and
play-space discreet. Read Attending a Munch or Social to learn more.


▼ Am I too young/too old/too fat/too short/too whatever?


If you're under 18, you're too young.

RKS members range from 18 to 60+ with a variety of body shapes and sizes,
political views, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, gender identities, gender expressions, races,
interests, experiences, and needs, etc.


▼ Are Masters/ slaves/ sluts/whatever welcome?


Yes. Our members are free to express themselves no matter what their kink or level of interest, within the boundaries of play party rules.

Please see etiquette.


▼ I'm single/ married/ polyamorous/whatever. Can I join?

Yes. Your preferred relationship style is unique to you.
We have members who are single, coupled, and in multi-person relationships.
Some play only with their partners, others have open relationships regarding play.
Some of our members have long-term, established vanilla (non-kinky) relationships and use RKS as an avenue to express their kinky side.

▼ So I can just show up and have sex with people?

No.

RKS does not allow sex or other forms of penetration. RKS is a social club, not a sex club.

If you want a chance to play with others, you'll need to make friends with them first.

Although each member has their own level of comfort for how well they need to know someone before playing, anonymous play is rare.

Couples interesting in swinging may want to look into Candle Light Associates and Exotic Fantasies.


▼ What if I'm not kinky enough? What if I don't like pain?

RKS doesn't have a hard definition for being kinky, and by no means do all kinks involve pain.

RKS is about education. And many new members are not sure where their interests lie.

Attending munches and socials, as well as events at the RKS Dungeon allow you to:
talk to members about their experiences,
ask questions about things that interest you;
view members varying play styles at the dungeon,
attend workshops to learn about topics that spark your interest; and
make new friends and possible play partners.
If you've assumed or guessed what RKS is all about without seeing for yourself, then you've probably gotten the wrong idea.

Kink can be anything you and your play partner define. It can be:
as simple as using a feather to erotically tickle your partner,
dressing up and role playing, or
using rope not to restrict movement but hold a toy (or even just a strategically placed knot) in place.
One of the amazing things about sexuality is how nuanced it can be? and at RKS, we embrace that full range of kink.

▼ Is the RKS dungeon handicap accessible?


Yes. The main entrance is wheelchair accessible. However, all doors are locked. You'll need to ring our doorbell,
which is at the side entrance. After the attendant has to come to the door and become aware of your needs, that
person can let you in the main entrance and show you to one of the elevators. Contacting us ahead of time is not
mandatory, but can help us plan accordingly.

Bathrooms are on the same floor as RKS. Each bathroom has a stall that's large enough to accommodate wheelchairs, although there are not yet grab bars installed.


▼ How much does RKS cost?


Attending a munch, social, or movie is free. Coming as a guest is presently $25 per visit. The most common membership ("Standard") is $60 per quarter, but there are other types of memberships see the membership rates for more information.

Workshop costs varies, depending on whether we have a local or visiting presenter, whether you are a guest or member, and the type of membership.


▼ What payment forms are accepted?


Cash, check, and credit cards are accepted for all fees.


▼ What are RKS' rules?


See attending parties and play party rules. It's also a good idea to review scene etiquette.


▼ I'm coming into town overnight for a play party. Where can I stay? How do I get around?

Given the short distances and our lacking public transit to match all our hours of operation, we suggest walking, taxi, and hotel shuttle.
If using hotel shuttle, check with your hotel to ensure they'll pick you up until 2am when our parties close.
If you prefer the bus, the Radisson and Hyatt may be better choices: Rochester has a spoke-based transit system, and the hub is just outside these hotels, avoiding a pay-and-delay transfer to get just about anywhere. Transit shuts down about midnight.

keep hotel table/info as is, but should add links to reputable taxi services


▼ I'm coming in to do a workshop, and I want to make a video slide presentation. Does RKS have the facilities?

We do have a video projector in our main dungeon. If you want to bring just your presentation and use our laptop, it can read CDs, DVDs, and USB drives. It's loaded with KeyNote. For PowerPoint or OpenOffice, please send your presentation with plenty of advance to RKS Publications and we can check it out, make minor fixes if necessary, or arrange a machine with the necessary software to display the presentation properly.

If you prefer to use your own laptop, we have have hookups for:
