          <h3 id="covid-19-precautions">Covid-19 Precautions</h3>
          <ol type="1">
          <li>Do not attend our in person events if you are ill or have been exposed to an illness transmissible through indirect contact*.</li>
          <li>The RKS Board may request an event attendee to wear mask and/or turn away event attendees that appear sick.</li>
          <li>The RKS Board reserves the right to amend these rules to reflect current infection rates in Monroe County, the guidance of the CDC, and New York State's department of health.</li>
          </ol>
          It is considered a consent violation to attend an event after having been knowingly exposed.
We will continue using our air filters at in-person events in the RKS play space, and we encourage you to take whatever COVID precautions fit your risk profile.
*examples of these illnesses include, but are not limited to, flu, strep, RSV, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, and COVID.
          <h3 id="safety">Safety</h3>
          <ol type="1" class="spaced">
          <li><b>Do not</b> take actions that put RKS, its membership, or its reputation at risk.</li>
          <li>RKS provides basic first-aid supplies in cases of necessity. Please let a Board Member know if these become necessary.</li>
          <li>If you are engaging in play that will require medical supplies, it is your responsibility to provide those supplies.</li>
          <li>Firearms, realistic replicas of firearms, unrealistic replicas of firearms, and airsoft weapons are banned at RKS events. This ban does not include anything the general shape of a gun but that cannot be confused with one such as a nerf gun, super soaker, or rubber band gun. The board or their representative(s) has final ability to decide what is a realistic/unrealistic replica and what is “in the general shape of a gun but that cannot be confused with one”. If you’re unsure if your item would be banned, check with the board at rks@rochesterkinksociety.com no less than 48 hours before the event.</li>
          <li>Securing anything worn around the neck to a hard point is prohibited.</li>
          <li>Board members on duty are required to know who present is trained to use the AED.</li>
          <li>RKS parties are drug and alcohol free. Any attendee who appears to be intoxicated or under the influence of drugs will be asked to leave.</li>
          <li>In the event of an emergency, please let the Board Member on duty handle any 911 calls. We have the address and can make sure the emergency personnel known where to go and how to get to us.</li>
          <li>RKS Board Members will respond to safewords. If a person in the scene uses “Red” or “Safeword” in a scene, the players must immediately halt their activity. If safewords are not immediately responded to, a Board Member will intervene in your scene.</li>
          <li>In any scene where a player will be gagged or otherwise unable to vocalize a safeword, the players must use an alternative safe signal. The default nonverbal safeword at RKS is using a hand to make the peace symbol (a V using first two fingers). If a gagged bottom will have their hands bound/mitted in such a way as to not be visible, provide the Board Member on duty with an alternative.</li>
          <li>Please be aware of the noise levels of your scene. If a scene draws multiple complaints, the Board Member on duty may intervene to request the use of a gag.</li>
          <li>Board Members are empowered to stop any scene that they deem to be unsafe or that is not abiding by the rules. If you intend to engage play which might appear unsafe or non consensual, please inform the Board Member on duty ahead of time. Your scene is less likely to be interrupted if you inform a Board Member ahead of time when engaging in edge play, such as knife play or piercing; needle play and other bloodletting scenes, fire play, and consensual non-consent play.</li>
          <li>Attendees who refuse to obey the rules will be asked to leave.</li>
          </ol>

          </ul></li>

You may use any free standing extinguisher not currently in a scene.</li>
          <li>There will be fire extinguishers mounted in every room. These are not to be removed except in the case of an emergency or by a Board Member’s approval.</li>
