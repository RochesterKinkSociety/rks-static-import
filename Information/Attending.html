                <p>
                    The RKS Board trusts and encourages members to bring guests to RKS events. Members in good
					standing (who have been members for a minimum of 6 months) may bring guests to events with as
					little as 48 hours notice. Those still in the trial membership period (initial 6 months) that would like to
					bring a guest must consult with the Board as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        If you are thinking about bringing a guest to an RKS
                        event, here is what you need to do:
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Inform the RKS Board, via email to <a href="mailto:rsvp@RochesterKinkSociety.com">rsvp@RochesterKinkSociety.com</a>
                        of your intention to bring a guest to an RKS event.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The RKS Secretary to the Board will verify that your guest is
                        not among the short list of banned individuals.
                    </li>
                    <li>If your guest is not on the list, they are approved!</li>
                    <li>
                        While we still like to meet potential guests at munches and
                        socials, and we encourage members to bring friends to those, there
                        is no requirement that your guest must attend one first. We trust
                        you!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                            Note: The above applies only to members who have completed
                            their trial membership periods.
                        </em> Trial members must submit guest requests and wait for
                        approval prior to bringing the guest.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>
                    If you bring a guest to an RKS event, you are agreeing to be
                    responsible for your guest and their behavior during that event.
                    Please make sure that you discuss the <a href="Etiquette.html">
                    RKS Etiquette</a> and <a href="Rules.html">play-party rules</a> with
                    your guests so that they are familiar with what is expected of
                    them. Specifically make sure that your guest clearly understands
                    our confidentiality requirements.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Your guests must sign a guest waiver, available at the front
                        table. Also, make sure your guest is aware of the guest fee. 
						Finally, please make sure
                        your guest knows that they may be required to show their valid
                        driver's license at the door. This may be verified by an RKS Board
                        member, but no information will be kept (aside from the guest
                        waiver).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is a good idea, and helpful, if you introduce your guest to
                        Board Members who are in attendance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repeatedly bringing troublesome, disrespectful, or otherwise
                        poorly-chosen guests may result in a loss of inviting privilege for
                        the responsible member.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        First-time guests may not <em>join</em> RKS the evening of
                        their first event. They may <em>apply</em> for membership at their
                        first event, but a decision will not be made until after the
                        event.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Returning Guests</h3>
                <p>
                    Once a guest has attended an RKS event, and RKS has obtained a
                    signed guest waiver, the guest may subsequently return without
                    being the guest of a member. However, the returning guest must
                    <a href="mailto:rspv@RochesterKinkSociety.com">RSVP <span class="printonly">(rspv@RochesterKinkSociety.com)</span></a> at least 48
                    hours in advance. On arrival at a party, they must pay the guest
                    fee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are no limits to the number of times or frequency at which
                    a guest may attend.
                </p>
				<p>
					All guests should email the Board (<a href="mailto:rspv@RochesterKinkSociety.com">rks@rochesterkinksociety.com</a>)
					to verify the location of the event they are interested in attending.
				</p>

                            Attend a munch or social, or both, or many. You'll see a number of us attending

                        </b>

                        It's never a bad idea to talk to members and guests. Get to know people.
                        Many of our members and guests attend multiple socials and munches throughout
                        the month to see friends and make new friends. Most people walk away from an
                        RKS munch or social feeling like they just found where they belong.

                    <li>
                        <b>Talk to as many RKS Board Members as possible</b><br />
                        This will start the vetting process. Each potential member/guest is vetted by the RKS Board and other
                        members before attending a non-public event and for membership purposes. The vetting process is to help
                        assure the safety of all our members and guests.

                        <b>Email the RKS Board to attend a party/workshop/event</b><br />
                        The board
						typically responds to a Rochester Kink Society email within 48 hours.
						The more people you talked to at the munches and socials, the faster the

						us. Once you have attended these events, you may apply for membership.

                <p>
                    The RKS Trial Membership process is designed to 
					allow potential new members the
					chance to get to know us, and for us to get to know them, before 
					making a large financial commitment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All new RKS members will start out on the trial membership period. First, a new member must
					complete a trial period of 6 months. The cost for the Trial Membership is $10 per member for a
					period of six months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the completion of the 6 month trial period, the Board of Directors and the member
					shall consider and decide upon membership continuation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Trial Members are entitled to most of the RKS 
					Membership rights with the following exceptions:

                        Trial Members may not invite guests who have

						without specific permission from the Board of Directors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Trial Members must attend a minimum of 2 RKS events during 
						their trial period to be considered
						for full membership after the trial period ends.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Trial Members have all other RKS Members 
						Rights including access to the
						Members Only list, attendance to RKS events, and voting rights.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    At any point during the trial period, the Board 
					of Directors may terminate the member’s involvement with the 
					group without having to adhere to the disciplinary procedure 
					in place for members.
