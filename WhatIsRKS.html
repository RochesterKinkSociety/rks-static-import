                        <b>Education - </b>
                        RKS was founded with a focus on fostering and educating the local kink community. We host workshops 
                        and classes typically twice a month from presenters ranging from our own members, to regional talent, and 
                        even nationally known educators.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Longevity - RKS has been around for over 20 years - </b>
                        Thanks to a vibrant community of dedicated members and volunteers, RKS has become a 2nd home to many and a 
                        family to its membership.

                    <b>If you're thinking, "Because I read 50 Shades of Grey," then you absolutely should attend a munch or social.</b><br />
                    <p>
                        Although the books and movie have brought attention to BDSM, the reality is that 50 Shades is full of 
                        misinformation about what it is that we do. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        RKS is about education, and we would love to spend some time helping you understand how we value safe, sane and
                        consensual BDSM.

                            A few times yearly, we hold a Town Hall Meeting where members can gather at the space for a pot
                            luck dinner and sit down to discuss items of concern to the membership with the Board members.

                            Although RKS is not a dating service, the reality is that to meet like-minded people for play and
                            relationships, you need to be around like-minded people. And, RKS is a safe space for exploration and learning.

                            Learning about the lifestyle is a huge step for most of us. We've all been there. New and unsure
                            but wanting to try all-of-the-things, right now. Come see us at a social or munch and decide for yourself.
                            Our guests and members ensure that Rochester will continue to have a lifestyle group to educate and
