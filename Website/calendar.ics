SUMMARY:May 14 RKS Play Party - Flagging Theme
DESCRIPTION:Cost: Free for RKS Members\, $15 for Bronze Member
 s\, $25 for Approved Guests\n Location: At the RKS
  Space\n Dress Code: Casual\, Fetish\, Nothing at 
 All (once inside)\n \n Join us for our regularly s
 cheduled play party!\n \n This month instead of gi
 ving the first Friday party a theme\, we&#39\;re g
 iving THIS one a theme! &nbsp\;Join us for our Fla
 gging Party!\n \n What&#39\;s flagging? &nbsp\;Tra
 ditionally\, The Hanky Code is a form of signallin
 g to others what your sexual preferences and inter
 ests are. Gay men used this code to communicate wi
 th each other in the noisy and distracting environ
 ment of gay bars. Although not as widely used thes
 e days\, it is still a worthwhile resource and is\
 , among those who know\, a great conversation star
 ter.\n \n While it used to be a code for gay men -
  now anyone can flag!\n \n When flagging\, you buy
  and wear certain color hanky (bandana) - in the l
 eft or right back pocket to signal interest or spe
 cialization in particular practices. &nbsp\;Note t
 hat in dungeons\, people tend to wear these where 
 ever possible (since sometimes there are no pocket
 s). &nbsp\;What IS important is what side of the b
 ody you wear your flag on. &nbsp\;For example\, if
  you wear a grey bandana on your left side - it me
 ans you are a rope top. &nbsp\;If you wear the gre
 y bandana on your right side it signals your inter
 est in being tied up!\n \n Here is a great resourc
 e for finding what the many\, many colors mean: &n
 bsp\;https://user.xmission.com/~trevin/hanky.html\
 n \n Remember - participation in themes is always 
 encouraged but is never required. &nbsp\;Feel free
  to party on without paying attention to flags if 
 you wish!\n \n We are open from 8 p.m. until 2 a.m
 . &nbsp\;Please arrive by 11 p.m.!\n \n This party
  is open to all RKS members\, their guests\, and a
