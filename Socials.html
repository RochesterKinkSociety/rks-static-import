            <h2>Attending a Munch or Social</h2>
            Those new to our community will meet us by attending a munch or
            social. You do not need to attend both, but may do so if you wish.
            <p>
                The munch and social
                allow our members to stay in touch with each other. They also allow
                those interested in joining to learn about the group and introduce
                themselves before attending a party. This lets you make sure RKS is
                what you're looking for, and lets us protect our members'
                confidentiality and our society's integrity. Attend as frequently
                as you like; these are our "public" events and we're happy to have
                others interested in the scene to talk to.
            </p>
            <p>
                All munches and socials are free to attend, other than paying
                for your own food, drink, and service. Munches are held at a
                restaurant, whereas socials are held at a bar. Although RKS has a
                no-alcohol policy at parties, there is no such restriction for the
                munch or social. At our social locations, ages 18-20 are welcome to
				attend although they are unable to purchase alcohol.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once
				you arrive, we are often easily identified. In our regular munch and social
				locations, we are typically in a backroom or private room area. You can
				also ask for us by asking for “RKS”. Our event announcements usually
				indicate where we will be. We are typically on the look out for new faces,
				and will make sure to greet you when you arrive!
            </p>
            <p>
                The munch and social are essentially the same: a luncheon where
                we share conversation over food. Discussion typically centers on
                topics relating to the lifestyle, but also flows through current
                events, technological discussions, and a variety of other topics.
                There are usually enough people attending that there are several
                separate conversations going on concurrently.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a new person interested in our group, we'll be interested in
                you. You'll be given a handout with more information about RKS and
                the next steps involved in joining. You will, at some point, be
                asked how you found us and what is your interest in our group and
                the lifestyle. There are no right or wrong answers; we just want to
                know more about you. When you're ready to take your involvement in
                RKS to the next level, be sure to talk to a board member about
                <a href="Parties.html">coming to a party</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the similarity of the two events, within RKS a <i>munch</i> refers
				to events held in the at area restaurants/diners, typically in the afternoons,
				whereas a <i>social</i> refers to events held in area bars, typically in the evening.
            </p>
            <h3 id="H1">Social: Bathtub Billy's</h3>
            Eighteen and up are welcome, but you must be 21 or older to order
            alcohol. The Tub offers a range of beers and other alcohol, with a
            variety of typical bar food, including their signature mac and
            cheese variations. We meet in the private party room in the back,
            which we have to ourselves that evening, including the indoor bocce
            ball range.

            <h3 id="H3">Munches: Jay's Diner</h3>
            RKS hosts a munch monthly at Jay’s Diner. All those 18 and over are
			welcome.
            Jay's Diner serves the typical range of 50's-style diner food,
            including breakfast all day, sandwiches, burgers, wraps, and some
            more substantial dinners. They do not serve alcohol. Most meals
            will run $10–15 with a drink, except for dinners which are $15–20.
            There is a 10% student discount with college ID.
