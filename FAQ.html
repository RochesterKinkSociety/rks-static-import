                            BDSM stands for:
                            <ul>
                                <li>bondage and discipline (BD)</li>
                                <li>dominance and submission (DS)</li>
                                <li>sadism and masochism (SM)</li>
                            </ul>
                            These initials (BD, DS, SM) are then run together, removing the duplicate letters to form BDSM.
                            <br />
                            Each letter pair represents subtly different types of play and interaction commonly found
                            within our community.

                            <h4>How is BDSM different from abuse?</h4>
                        </button>
                        <div class="collapse" id="a-abuse">
                            BDSM is not abuse. To contrast the two, let us first take a look at what abuse is,
                            then see how BDSM is different.
                            <br />
                            Abuse is:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Unwanted verbal, emotional, or physical violence, often occurring in an accelerating cycle.</li>
                                <li>Characterized by <b>lack of consent</b> of one person to the actions of another.</li>
                                <li>Victim is often isolated and lacks ability to stop the violence or leave.</li>
                                <li>Occurs in secrecy, and results in emotional or physical injury.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br />
                            Quite the opposite, BDSM
                            <ul>
                                <li>Occurs between freely consenting adults.</li>
                                <li>Is practiced with all participants aware of the potential risks and a mind towards increasing safety.</li>
                                <li>Includes explicit consent of the participants to their involvement.</li>
                                <li>Participants retain the right to stop involvement (or leave entirely) at any time if they choose to do so.</li>
                                <li>Involves the use of safe words, allowing participants to communicate clearly.</li>
                                <li>Many will not practice BDSM while under the influence of alcohol or drugs; neither alcohol nor drug use are allowed at RKS.</li>
                            </ul>
                            Furthermore, our events are staffed by dungeon monitors to ensure adherence to RKS' rules.

                                It is a way for you to check out the group, first of all. We do this to protect our
                                members and our society's integrity and confidentiality. In a nutshell, we like to
                                keep our regular meeting location and play-space discreet.

                                RKS members range from 18 to 60+ with a variety of body shapes and sizes,
                                political views, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, gender
                                identities, gender expressions, races, interests, experiences, and needs, etc.

                            We have members who are single, coupled, and in multi-person relationships.
                            Some play only with their partners, others have open relationships regarding play.
                            Some of our members have long-term, established vanilla (non-kinky) relationships
                            and use RKS as an avenue to express their kinky side.

                            RKS does not allow sex or other forms of penetration. RKS is a social club, not a sex club.
                            <br />
                            If you want a chance to play with others, you'll need to make friends with them first.
                            <br />
                            Although each member has their own level of comfort for how well they need to know
                            someone before playing, anonymous play is rare.
                            <br />
                            Couples interesting in swinging may want to look into Candle Light Associates and Exotic Fantasies.

                            <h4>What if I'm not kinky enough? What if I don't like pain?</h4>

                            <p>
                                RKS doesn't have a hard definition for being kinky, and by no means do all kinks involve pain.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                RKS is about education. And many new members are not sure where their interests lie.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Attending munches and socials, as well as events at the RKS Dungeon allow you to:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>talk to members about their experiences.</li>
                                    <li>ask questions about things that interest you.</li>
                                    <li>view members varying play styles at the dungeon.</li>
                                    <li>attend workshops to learn about topics that spark your interest.</li>
                                    <li>make new friends and possible play partners.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you've assumed or guessed what RKS is all about without seeing for yourself, then you've probably gotten the wrong idea.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Kink can be anything you and your play partner define. It can be:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>as simple as using a feather to erotically tickle your partner.</li>
                                    <li>dressing up and role playing.</li>
                                    <li>using rope not to restrict movement but hold a toy (or even just a strategically placed knot) in place.</li>
                                </ul>
                                One of the amazing things about sexuality is how nuanced it can be? and at RKS, we embrace that full range of kink.
                            </p>

                                Attending a munch, social, or movie is free. Coming as a guest to a play party is 
								presently $25 per visit and only $10 for the first time.
                                The most common membership ("Silver") is $60 per quarter, but there are other types of
                                memberships see the membership rates for more information.

                            Given the short distances and our lacking public transit to match all our hours of operation,
                            we suggest walking, taxi, and hotel shuttle.

                                    If you prefer the bus, the Radisson and Hyatt may be better choices: Rochester has
                                    a spoke-based transit system, and the hub is just outside these hotels, avoiding a
                                    pay-and-delay transfer to get just about anywhere.
